<div><h2>Low and Slow</h2></div>
<div><p>posted by BGB, november 15, 2016</p></div>
<div><p>this week i am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking tecnique called <i>sous vide. In sous vide </i>
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the 
target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In this book, <i>cooking for grreks,</i>jeff potter describes it as "ultra-low-temperature poaching"</p></div>
<div><p>Next month, we will be serving <i><strong>sous vide salmon with Dill Hollandia.</strong></i> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p></div>
